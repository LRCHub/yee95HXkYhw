You kissed me then you had
to leave
No I can't stop thinking of you,
of you
You left behind your
favorite ring
I guess I have to give it to
you soon, to you soon
Now I am waiting patiently
like a puppet on a string
You do as you will and
I won't mind
I see you in everything,
want a house up on the hill
Is that too much to ask, girl,
is it right?
If only with you
If only with you
If only with you
If only with you, with you
We met up in a parking lot
Listening to her silent thoughts
With open arms you take me
as a fool
You said you have somewhere
to go
I wonder if she even knows
I like it when I have
something to prove
Now I am waiting patiently
like a puppet on a string
You do as you will,
and I won't mind
I see you in everything,
want a house up on the hill
Is that too much to ask, girl,
is it right?
If only with you
If only with you
If only with you
If only with you, with you
If only with you
You held my hand
The lights turned down low
I didn't say much,
'cause you had to go
I'm here where I stand,
where the flowers grow
If only in you
If only with you
If only with you
If only with you, with you
If only with you
